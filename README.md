# Control: Introduction to R Functions

## Exercises:

* Exercise 1: Create a function that read a data sequence and a number (or character). Function returns the sequence, but it changes to `NA` symbol the data from sequence that is the same as the given number (or character).

* Exercise 2: Create a function that returns `TRUE` if a given integer is inside of a vector.

* Exercise 3: Create a function that return the solutions from a quadratic equation.

* Exercise 4: Create a function from a vector and integer. It will return the number of times the number appears on the vector.

* Exercise 5: Create a function from a vector that print the mean and standard deviation from it.

* Exercise 6: Create a function from a integer, it will calculate the number of divisors from the given number (regardless 1 or itself).
